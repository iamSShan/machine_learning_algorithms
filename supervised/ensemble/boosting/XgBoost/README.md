## XgBoost

* It stands for eXtreme gradient Boosting.
* XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.) artificial neural networks tend to outperform all other algorithms or frameworks.
* Generally, XGBoost is fast. Really fast when compared to other implementations of gradient boosting.
* XGBoost dominates structured or tabular datasets on classification and regression predictive modeling problems.

* The evidence is that it is the go-to algorithm for competition winners on the Kaggle competitive data science platform.
* The XGBoost library implements the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm.
