    "#### Why Multicollinearity is a problem?\n",
    "* Multicollinearity can be a problem in a regression model because we would not be able to distinguish between the individual effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable. For example, let’s assume that in the following linear equation: \n",
    "    * Y = W0+W1*X1+W2*X2\n",
    "\n",
    "* Coefficient W1 is the increase in Y for a unit increase in X1 while keeping X2 constant. But since X1 and X2 are highly correlated, changes in X1 would also cause changes in X2 and we would not be able to see their individual effect on Y.\n",
    "* As we know, in regression we want to understand, impact of all the variables individually on target, but multicollinearity prevents that. So that's why multicollinearity is a problem. \n",
    "* Multicollinearity may not affect the accuracy of the model as much"

    "    * **For eg: There are some features like X1 X2 X3 X4 X5, then we try to fit regression model, first time treating X1 as target feature and rest as independent feature. And then we calculate R^2 for this and we use this value in VIF formula:VIF = 1/(1-R^2)**\n",
