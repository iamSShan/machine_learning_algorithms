- It is used find latent variable. Latent variables are those variables which are not directly observed, and we cannot derive these variables. We can just infer them from previously observed variable.
- EM Algo is basic for many unsupervised clustering algorithms

Steps involved in EM algo:
1. Initially, a set of initial values are considered and we need to give that to system(all those values are incomplete)
2. Expectation step: We use observed data to estimate or guess the values of missing or incomplete data.
3. Maximization step: Here we use complete data generated in previous step to update the values.
4. We check if values are converging or not, if converging then stop otherwise repeat Step 2 and 3 till convergence occurs.

Use of EM:
- Used to fill missing data.
- Used for unsupervised learning
- Used to discover values of latent variable

Advantages:
- With each iteration, likelihood increases
- E-step and M-step are easy to implement

Disadvantages:
- Slow convergence
