## Feature Engineering:

* Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge or by data visualization or by using statistics methods to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data.
* In other words, Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.


## Feature: 

* A feature is a property shared by independent units on which analysis or prediction is to be done. Features are used by predictive models and influence results.
* A feature is an attribute that is useful or meaningful to your problem.

## Feature Importance:

* An estimate of the usefulness of a feature.
* Features are allocated scores and can then be ranked by their scores. Those features with the highest scores can be selected for inclusion in the training dataset, whereas those remaining can be ignored.

## High Level Feature Engineering steps:

- (tasks before here…)
- Select Data: Integrate data, de-normalize it into a dataset, collect it together.
- Preprocess Data: Format it, clean it, sample it so you can work with it.
- Transform Data: Feature Engineering happens here.
- Model Data: Create models, evaluate them and tune them.
- (tasks after here…)


**Outlier detection, one hot encoding, handling missing values are few basic examples of feature engineering.**
