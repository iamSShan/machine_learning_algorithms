    "## Covariance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of how two random variables change together. It tells us whether an increase in one variable corresponds to an increase or decrease in another variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "* Positive Covariance: If the variables tend to increase together, the covariance is positive.\n",
    "* Negative Covariance: If one variable tends to increase when the other decreases, the covariance is negative.\n",
    "* Zero Covariance: If the variables are independent of each other, the covariance is close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "For two variables X and Y with means μX and μY:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Cov(X, Y) = ∑(Xi−μX)(Yi−μY)/n−1\n",
    "Where n is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose we have the following pairs of values for XX and YY:\n",
    "\n",
    "    X=[1,2,3,4,5] and Y=[2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance of X and Y would be positive, indicating that as X increases, Y also increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantage**: Covariance cannot describe magnitude of correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pearson Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson correlation (also known as Pearson's r) measures the linear relationship between two variables. **It gives both the direction and the strength of the relationship.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range: The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "  * +1: Perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "  * 0: No linear relationship.\n",
    "  * -1: Perfect negative linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linear Relationship: Only captures linear relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: For two variables X and Y:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    r = Cov(X,Y)/σXσY\n",
    "\n",
    "    Where σX and σY are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Using the same values as before:\n",
    "\n",
    "    X=[1,2,3,4,5] and Y=[2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation would be +1, indicating a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spearman Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman correlation measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Monotonic Relationship**: Captures both linear and non-linear monotonic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Range: The Spearman correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "  * +1: Perfect positive monotonic relationship.\n",
    "  * 0: No monotonic relationship.\n",
    "  * -1: Perfect negative monotonic relationship.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "For two variables X and Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rank the data points in XX and YY.\n",
    "2. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient on the ranked variables R(X)and R(Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Using the same values as before:\n",
    "\n",
    "    X=[1,2,3,4,5] and Y=[2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman correlation would also be +1, indicating a perfect positive monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Covariance: Measures how two variables change together. Positive covariance means they increase together, negative means one increases while the other decreases.\n",
    "* Pearson Correlation: Measures the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. A value close to +1 or -1 indicates a strong linear relationship, while a value close to 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "* Spearman Correlation: Measures the monotonic relationship (not necessarily linear) between two variables, also ranging from -1 to 1. It is based on the ranked values of the variables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "Monotonic relationships can indeed be non-linear, but not all non-linear relationships are monotonic. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A monotonic relationship between two variables is one in which the variables move in a consistent direction relative to each other. Specifically:\n",
    "* Monotonically Increasing: As one variable increases, the other variable either always increases or stays the same.\n",
    "* Monotonically Decreasing: As one variable increases, the other variable either always decreases or stays the same    "
