Data:
====
Data: Facts or pieces of information that can be measured. Eg: IQ of class students, ages of students in class
Data are of two types:
 - Qualitative: Qualitative data deals with characteristics	and descriptors that can't be easily measured but can be observed subjectively.
 - Quantitative: Quantitative data deals with numbers and things you can measure objectively.

 Qualitative can be divided into:
 - Nominal data: Data with no inherent order or ranking such as gender or race, such kind of data is called Nominal data.
 - Ordinal data: Data with ordered series. Like Ratings (Good, Avg, Bad) for different customers.

 Quantitative can be divided into:
 - Discrete data: Also known as categorical data, it can hold number of possible values. E.g: Number of students in class, email is spam or not.
 - Continuous data: Data that can hold infinite number of possible values. Eg: Weight of the person.


Statistics:
==========
 - Statistics is science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data.
 - It is an Area of applied mathematics concerned with the data collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation.
 - Applied mathematics involves the application of mathematics to problems which arise in various areas, e.g. physics, engineering, medicine, biology, business, computer science, and industry, and/or the development of new or improved methods to meet the challenges of new problems. Thus, Applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge.

- We view applied math as the application of mathematics to real-world problems with the dual goal of explaining observed phenomena and predicting new, as yet unobserved, phenomena. Therefore, the emphasis is on both the mathematics, e.g. the development of new methods to meet the challenges of new problems, and the real world.
 
Types of Statistics:
===================
	1) Descriptive Stats: It consists of organizing and summarizing data

	2) Inferential Stats: Technique where in we use the data that we have measured to form conclusion.

	Eg: There is a class of students with following marks: {86, 87, 78, 55, 76, 69, 70,....}
	Questions that will be in descriptive stats:
		- Mean/Median/Mode of marks of students
	Questions that will be in inferential stats:
		- Are the marks of this class student similar to other class student marks?

Basic terminologies used in Statistics:
======================================
 - Population(denoted by N): A collection or set of individuals or objects or events whose properties are to be analyzed.
 - Sample(denoted by n): A subset of population.
 - Population Mean: Mean of population. Denoted by μ. Formula: μ = ( Σ Xi ) / N. Here population vaiance: σ² =  Σ(i=1 to n) (xi-μ)^2/N
 - Sample mean: Mean of a sample. Denoted by x̄. Formula:  x̄ = ( Σ xi ) / n. For sample variance here: S² = Σ(i=1 to n) (xi-x̄)^2 / n-1
 - Why we divide by n-1 in sample variance(because of unbiased estimation/Bessel's correction): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGsRwB3TsiE&t=140s or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkaU2ur3Ymw&t=305s
 
Sampling:
========
* Sampling helps a lot in research. It is one of the most important factors which determines the accuracy of your research/survey result.
* Population is the collection of the elements which has some or the other characteristic in common. Number of elements in the population is the size of the population.
* Sample is the subset of the population. The process of selecting a sample is known as sampling. Number of elements in the sample is the sample size.

* Different types of sampling techniques used in statistics:

- Probabilistic sampling(probability sampling):
  --------------------------------------------
  * This Sampling technique uses randomization to make sure that every element of the population gets an equal chance to be part of the selected sample. It’s alternatively known as random sampling.
  * Types of Probabilistic sampling techniques:

  i) Simple random sampling: In this case each individual is chosen entirely by chance and each member of the population has an equal chance, or probability. It is used when we don’t have any kind of prior information about the target population. 	For e.g: You want to select a simple random sample of 1000 employees of a social media marketing company. You assign a number to every employee in the company database from 1 to 1000, and use a random number generator to select 100 numbers.

  ii) Systematic sampling:
   - Here the selection of elements is systematic and not random except the first element.
   - Individuals are selected at regular intervals from the sampling frame. The intervals are chosen to ensure an adequate sample size. If you need a sample size n from a population of size x, you should select every x/nth individual for the sample.
   - For example, if you wanted a sample size of 100 from a population of 1000, select every 1000/100 = 10th member of the sampling frame. 
   To get sample of size n, we divide our population of size N into subgroups of k elements.
   We select our first element randomly from the first subgroup of k elements. To select other elements of sample, perform following:
   	-- We know number of elements in each group is k i.e N/n
   	-- So if our first element is n1 then Second element is n1+k i.e n2, Third element n2+k i.e n3 and so on..
   	-- Taking an example of N=20, n=5; No of elements in each of the subgroups is N/n i.e 20/5 =4= k
   	-- Now, randomly select first element from the first subgroup. If we select n1= 3
   	-- n2 = n1+k = 3+4 = 7; n3 = n2+k = 7+4 = 11
  - This type of sampling is known as Systematic Random Sampling.

  - For eg: All employees of the company are listed in alphabetical order. From the first 10 numbers, you randomly select a starting point: number 6. From number 6 onwards, every 10th person on the list is selected (6, 16, 26, 36, and so on), and you end up with a sample of 100 people.

  iii) Stratified sampling:
    - When the population is split into non-overlapping groups(strata).
    - In this method, the population is first divided into subgroups (or strata) who all share a similar characteristic.
    - To use this sampling method, we divide the population into subgroups (called strata) based on the relevant characteristic (e.g., gender identity, age range, income bracket, job role).
    - The strata are then sampled individually
    - It is used when we might reasonably expect the measurement of interest to vary between the different subgroups, and we want to ensure representation from all the subgroups.
    - For example, in a study of stroke outcomes, we may stratify the population by sex, to ensure equal representation of men and women. The study sample is then obtained by taking equal sample sizes from each stratum. In stratified sampling, it may also be appropriate to choose non-equal sample sizes from each stratum. Here we need to have prior information about the population to create subgroups.

    - For eg:The company has 800 female employees and 200 male employees. You want to ensure that the sample reflects the gender balance of the company, so you sort the population into two strata based on gender. Then you use random sampling on each group, selecting 80 women and 20 men, which gives you a representative sample of 100 people, this is known as Stratified Random Sampling
  
  Ques: Can we do stratified sampling based on designation?
  Ans: No. For eg: Designation is: Dot net developer, Python developer, Java developer. Then there is a probaility that groups may overlap i.e Python developer might know Java
  But we can consider this stratified if profession are like doctor, engineer, etc.


  iv) Cluster sampling: In a clustered sample, subgroups of the population are used as the sampling unit, rather than individuals. The population is divided into subgroups, known as clusters, then the clusters are randomly selected to be included in the study. Clusters are identified using details such as age, sex, location etc. 
  Cluster sampling involves dividing the population into clusters, usually based on geographical or natural groupings, and then randomly selecting entire clusters for inclusion in the sample.
  
  - For eg: Imagine there is a researcher who wants to find out what students in a large state think about school lunches. The state is very big, and he don't have the time or resources to travel to every school. Here's what he does: He divides the entire state into school districts, which are groups of schools in nearby areas. These districts are your clusters. Instead of visiting every school, he randomly select a few entire school districts. Once he has selected these districts, he can go to each school in those districts and ask all the students about their opinions on school lunches.
  This method is easier and cheaper because he only have to visit a few areas, but there's a risk that the districts you selected might not perfectly represent all the schools in the state. However, it's a practical approach for large-scale surveys.
  - How it is different from stratified: Now, let's say we're still interested in students' opinions on school lunches, but this time, we want to make sure we get perspectives from students of different age groups: elementary, middle, and high school students. We start by dividing all the students in the state into these three groups based on their age. These groups are our strata. From each age group, we then randomly pick students to ask about their opinions. This way, we ensure that you get a good mix of answers from elementary, middle, and high school students.
  

  v) Multi-Stage Sampling: It is the combination of one or more methods described above.

  Notes:
  Which sampling can be used for following:
  1) Exit poll: simple random sampling
  2) RBI does a household survey: They fill survey from women, so either stratified sampling or convenience sampling
  3) Drug Testing: If drug is for specific age then stratifed else if for all then random


- Non probabilistic sampling(non-probability sampling):
  ----------------------------------------------------
  * It does not rely on randomization. This technique is more reliant on the researcher’s ability to select elements for a sample.
  * Outcome of sampling might be biased and makes difficult for all the elements of population to be part of the sample equally.
  * This type of sampling is also known as non-random sampling.
  * Types of Non probabilistic sampling techniques:
  i) Quota sampling: Quota sampling involves dividing the population into exclusive subgroups and then selecting a predetermined number of individuals from each subgroup. This method ensures that various subgroups are represented in the sample.
  Eg: A market researcher might want to ensure that their sample includes a specific number of people from different age groups and genders to reflect the target market demographics.
  
  ii) Referral/Snowball sampling: Snowball sampling is used when the desired sample characteristic is rare. It involves identifying a few individuals who meet the criteria and then asking them to refer others who also meet the criteria.
    Example: Researchers studying a rare disease might start with a few patients and ask them to refer other patients they know. This helps in reaching a larger sample of individuals with the disease.

  iii) Convenience sampling: Convenience sampling involves selecting individuals who are easiest to reach or contact. A researcher standing outside a mall and surveying people who walk by is using convenience sampling. This method is simple but may not represent the entire population accurately.
  iv) Judgmental or Purposive sampling: The researcher uses their expertise to select individuals that are most useful or representative for the study. The choice is based on specific criteria and the researcher’s judgment. Eg: An expert in environmental science might choose specific regions to study the effects of pollution based on known pollution levels and their expertise in the field.

  v) Voluntary response sampling: A voluntary response sample is mainly based on ease of access. Instead of the researcher choosing participants and directly contacting them, people volunteer themselves (e.g. by responding to a public online survey).
 vi) Expert Sampling: Expert sampling involves selecting individuals with specific expertise or knowledge relevant to the study. This method is often used when expert opinions are needed for research.

Random variables and its types: 
===============================
- A random variable is a numerical description of the outcome of a statistical experiment. A random variable that may assume only a finite number or an infinite sequence of values is said to be discrete; one that may assume any value in some interval on the real number line is said to be continuous.
- For eg: x = 24; here x is a random variable storing 24 as its value, y = "yoo"; here y is also random variable.
Types of random variable:
- Numerical random variable: Like age
  Two types of numerical random variable:
  -- Discrete random variable: number of people in family(whole number and can't be negative)
  -- Continuous random variable: weight of people in family, salary(it can be whole number or also can be float)
- Categorical random variable: Like gender


Variable Measurement Scales:
===========================
- 4 types of measured variable:
  -- Nominal data: Categorical data like colors, gender, type of flower
  -- Ordinal data: Here order matters of data, like ranks of students based on marks, or like ratings (Good, Avg, Bad) for different customers.
  -- Interval data: Here order and value both matters, natural zero is not present. Eg: Temperature range in Farenheit: 70-80, 80-90, 90-100 (here if 0 faranheit is there then we won't have any meaning of it)
  -- Ratio data: It has same properties as interval data, with an equal and definitive ratio between each data and absolute “zero” being treated as a point of origin. In other words, there can be no negative numerical value in ratio data. Ratio data has all properties of interval data such as – data should have numeric values, a distance between the two points are equal, etc. but, unlike interval data where zero is arbitrary, in ratio data, zero is absolute. An excellent example of ratio data is the measurement of heights. Height could be measured in centimeters, meters, inches, or feet. It is not possible to have a negative height. 

Mean, Median and Mode:
=====================
A measure of central tendency is a single value that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data. As such, measures of central tendency are sometimes called measures of central location.

Sample of height = {168, 170, 150, 160, 182, 140, 175}
Here mean(x̄) = sum of heights/n = 63.5
Mean specifies measure of central tendency. Which means most of the height will be falling in this region.

For e.g: x = [1,2,3,4,5]
Here, mean: is 3 for above case
But let's say, if we add a outlier to the list x = [1,2,3,4,5,50]; then mean will become 10.8
So we get a big number and different output from previous, so in this case if we want to find out measure of central tendency, we can use median.
For median, we sort the numbers first, then we take the central number. If total numbers are even them take average of middle two numbers. Therefore here median will be (3+4)/2 = 3.5

Mode: Number with maximum frequency.
The mode is the only measure you can use for nominal or categorical data that can't be ordered
For e.g: x = [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Mean here: 3 // Here 3 is measure of central tendency.

Weighted mean and Trimmed Mean:
==============================
Weighted mean: It is sum of products of each value and its weight, divide by sum of the weights. It is used to calculate mean when the values in the dataset have different importance or frequency.
For eg: We have 3 different model predictions, whose importance is: 0.2 0.3 and 0.5(which signify model 3 > model 2 > model 1) Now each model gives value 100000, now if we need find weighted average then we will can use: (0.2*100000 + 0.3*100000 + 0.5*100000) /(0.2+0.3+0.5)

Trimmed mean: It is calculated by removing a certain percentage of the smallest and largest values from the dataset and then taking the mean of remaining values. The percentage of values removed is called the trimming percentage. We can decide a number let's say 10% which is our trimmimg percentage, where we will remove bottom and top 10% values, and we can find remaining data mean. It is used to reduce the impact of outliers.

Frequency Distribution:
======================
Let's say our sample data is: Colors: [R, G, R, B, G, R, B, B]
color | freq | cummulative_freq
-------------------------------
R     |  3   |  3
G     |  2   |  5   
B     |  3   |  8
-------------------------------

For discrete variable we can draw a bar chart and when variable is continuous we can draw histogram


Measures of dispersion:
======================
Measures of dispersion are statistical tools used to describe the spread or variability within a data set. These measures provide insight into how much the data points differ from each other and from the central tendency of the data set (e.g., the mean). Understanding dispersion is crucial for interpreting the reliability and variability of data, and for comparing different data sets. Common measures of dispersion include the range, interquartile range (IQR), variance, standard deviation, and absolute deviation.

1) Range

The range is the simplest measure of dispersion, defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a data set. It gives a basic indication of the spread of the data but is highly sensitive to outliers.

Formula:
Range = Maximum value − Minimum value

2) Interquartile Range (IQR)

The IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is calculated as the difference between the 75th percentile (Q3) and the 25th percentile (Q1). It is less sensitive to outliers than the range.

Formula:
IQR = Q3 − Q1

3) Variance

The variance measures the average of the squared differeces between each data point and mean of the data set. It measures the average distance of each data point from mean and is useful in comparing the dispersion of datasets with different means. It is sensitive to outliers as we are squaring here, a big number coming and getting sqaured gets more bigger number.

Formula for a sample:
s^2 = (∑(I=1 to n)(xi−xˉ)^2) / n−1

Formula for a population:
σ^2 = (∑(I=1 to N)(xi−μ)^2) / N

    xi represents each data point.
    xˉ is the sample mean.
    μ is the population mean.
    n is the sample size.
    N is the population size.

4) Mean Absolute Deviation(MAD):
- It uses same formula as variance , but here instead of squaring we do mod:= (∑|xi−xˉ|) / n
- We use sqaring or mod to remove the effect of negative values
- It is less sensitive to outliers as we not are not squaring here
- We cannot use this for inferencing, if we know sample MAD then we can't find population MAD

5) Standard Deviation:
- It is square root of variance. It is useful in describing the shape of distribution. 
- Why std deviation exist, when we have variance? Because unit of std dev is same as data.
    - Let's understand with help of example: We are finding variance of 5 kids weights: 15, 17, 13, 11, 14; here we get our mean as 14. Now as we are squaring, when we calculate variance, we get unit as kg² not just kg, hence std deviation exist which calculates its sqrt and gives unit as kg

6) Coefficient of Variation(CV):
- The CV is the ratio of the std dev to the mean expressed as a percentage.
- The coefficient of variation is a statistical measure that expresses the amount of variability in a dataset relative to mean. It is dimensionless quantity expressed as percentage.
- Why we need coefficient of variation? Let's say we have 2 columns Salary and experience, if we calculate mean of both columns, we cannot compare mean of both as both are different. But we need to know, in which of the column, data is more near mean, then this comparison for both columns can be done by coefficient of variation.
- Formula: (std dev/mean)*100%
